/**
 * Next.js 16 config.
 *
 * T16 #309 (2026-04-19) — performance tuning:
 *  - `optimizePackageImports` rewrites `import * as Flags from "country-flag-icons/react/3x2"`
 *    so only the flag components actually referenced are bundled, instead of
 *    all 272 SVG components landing in every route that touches CountryFlag.
 *  - `echarts` similarly benefits — only the chart types the app uses ship.
 *  - AVIF/WebP image formats automatic for `next/image` usages.
 *  - `poweredByHeader: false` strips the `X-Powered-By: Next.js`
 *    fingerprint from responses (small security hygiene win).

 *  - Tags releases with the git SHA Vercel injects.
 *  - Tunnels Sentry events through `/monitoring` to dodge ad blockers
 *    that would otherwise drop client-side error reports — common with
 *    finance/political analyst audiences who run aggressive blockers.
 *
 * `silent: true` so the build log doesn't get a wall of Sentry chatter.
